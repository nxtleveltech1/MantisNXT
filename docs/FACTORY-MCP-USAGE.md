# Using Factory MCP Server for Coding

This guide explains how to use the Factory MCP server running on port 58952 to assist with coding tasks in MantisNXT.

## Quick Start

### 1. Ensure Factory MCP Server is Running

The Factory MCP server must be running on port 58952 before use. Verify it's running:

```bash
# Check if port is listening
curl http://localhost:58952/sse

# Or check in browser
# Open: http://localhost:58952
```

### 2. Configuration

The Factory MCP server is already configured in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "factory": {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "http://localhost:58952/sse"
  }
}
```

### 3. Using Factory MCP Tools in Cursor

Once configured and running, the Factory MCP tools are automatically available to me (the AI assistant). You can:

1. **Ask me to use Factory tools directly** - Just describe what you want to do
2. **I'll automatically discover available tools** - When you ask for help, I'll check what tools are available
3. **Use natural language** - Describe your coding task and I'll use the appropriate Factory tools

## Common Coding Tasks

### Example 1: Generate Code

**You:** "Create a new React component for a user profile card using Factory tools"

**I'll:** Use Factory MCP tools to generate the component code based on your requirements

### Example 2: Analyze Code

**You:** "Review this function and suggest improvements using Factory"

**I'll:** Use Factory's code analysis tools to review and provide suggestions

### Example 3: Refactor Code

**You:** "Refactor this component to use TypeScript with Factory"

**I'll:** Use Factory tools to transform and improve your code

### Example 4: Generate Tests

**You:** "Generate unit tests for this API route using Factory"

**I'll:** Use Factory's testing tools to create comprehensive test suites

## Available Factory MCP Tools

To discover what specific tools Factory provides, ask me:

- "What tools does the Factory MCP server provide?"
- "Show me available Factory MCP tools"
- "What can Factory help me with?"

Or I can check programmatically by querying the Factory server.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Start Factory Server** (if not already running)
   ```bash
   # Start your Factory MCP server on port 58952
   ```

2. **Ask for Help** - Just describe what you want to do in natural language

3. **I Use Factory Tools** - I'll automatically use the appropriate Factory MCP tools

4. **Review Results** - I'll present the results and code generated

5. **Iterate** - Refine your requests based on the output

## Practical Examples

### Building a New Feature

**You:** "I need to add a real-time notification system. Use Factory to help design and implement it."

**I'll:** 
- Use Factory to analyze your codebase structure
- Generate notification components
- Create the backend API endpoints
- Set up real-time WebSocket connections
- Generate tests

### Code Review

**You:** "Review the authentication middleware and suggest security improvements"

**I'll:**
- Use Factory to analyze the code
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Suggest improvements
- Generate improved code

### Documentation Generation

**You:** "Generate API documentation for all the routes in the app directory"

**I'll:**
- Use Factory to scan your routes
- Analyze route handlers
- Generate comprehensive API documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific** - The more details you provide, the better Factory can help
2. **Iterate** - Start with a general request, then refine based on results
3. **Combine Tools** - Factory works best when combined with other MCP servers
4. **Test Generated Code** - Always review and test code generated by Factory

## Troubleshooting

### Factory Tools Not Available

If Factory tools aren't appearing:

1. **Check Server Status**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:58952/sse
   ```

2. **Verify Configuration** - Check `.mcp.json` has the correct URL

3. **Restart Cursor** - Sometimes a restart is needed after configuration changes

4. **Check Logs** - Look at Factory server logs for connection issues

### Connection Errors

If you see connection errors:

- Ensure Factory server is running on port 58952
- Check firewall settings allow localhost connections
- Verify the endpoint path (`/sse` is standard, but may vary)

## Next Steps

1. **Start Your Factory Server** on port 58952
2. **Ask Me Anything** - I'll use Factory tools automatically
3. **Explore** - Try different requests to see what Factory can do
