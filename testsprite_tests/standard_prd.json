  "validation_criteria": [
    "Pricelist processing time (upload through activation) should reduce by target percentage compared to baseline.",
    "Data accuracy validated by achieving less than 1% validation failure rate post-automation.",
    "Stock visibility to cover over 98% of SKUs with real-time status updates.",
    "System reliability measured by API error rate of under 0.1% and p95 query latency below 500ms.",
