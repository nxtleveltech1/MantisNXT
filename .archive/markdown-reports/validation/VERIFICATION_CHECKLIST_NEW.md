# Authentication Fix - Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the authentication fix is working correctly.

## Pre-Flight Checks

- [ ] Current working directory is the project root
- [ ] `.env.local` file exists
- [ ] `ALLOW_PUBLIC_GET_ENDPOINTS` is configured in `.env.local`
- [ ] Development server is stopped

## Environment Configuration

- [ ] Open `.env.local` in your editor
- [ ] Verify the ALLOW_PUBLIC_GET_ENDPOINTS line exists
- [ ] No syntax errors (no spaces around `=`, no quotes)
- [ ] File saved

## Server Restart

- [ ] Kill any running Next.js dev server
- [ ] Start fresh server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Server starts successfully (typically port 3000)
- [ ] No startup errors in console

## Quick Verification

Run the automated test:

```bash
# Windows
scripts\test-auth-fix.bat

# Linux/Mac  
bash scripts/test-auth-fix.sh
```

Expected: ALL TESTS PASSED

## Success!

If tests pass, the authentication fix is working correctly.
