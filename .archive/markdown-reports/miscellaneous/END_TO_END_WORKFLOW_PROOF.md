## STEP 1: Supplier Created

### Database Proof
```sql
SELECT supplier_id, name, code, active, default_currency, payment_terms, created_at
FROM core.supplier
WHERE name = 'Active Music Distribution';
```

### Result:
```json
{
  "supplier_id": "b927dacc-5779-439b-82bf-82ae9c154c00",
  "name": "Active Music Distribution",
  "code": "ACTIVE",
  "active": true,
  "default_currency": "ZAR",
  "payment_terms": "Cash on Delivery",
  "created_at": "2025-10-11T10:32:40.007Z"
}
```

**✅ PROOF:** Supplier record exists in `core.supplier` table with ID: `b927dacc-5779-439b-82bf-82ae9c154c00`

---

## STEP 2: Pricelist Uploaded

### Database Proof
```sql
SELECT upload_id, supplier_id, filename, currency, valid_from, row_count, status, received_at
FROM spp.pricelist_upload
WHERE upload_id = '8c7822d6-25fa-4e0d-a924-fd8e9a823334';
```

### Result:

  "received_at": "2025-10-11T10:39:44.463Z"
}
```

### Pricelist Rows:
```sql

       ph.price, ph.currency, sp.is_active, sp.created_at
FROM core.supplier_product sp
LEFT JOIN core.price_history ph ON ph.supplier_product_id = sp.supplier_product_id
  AND ph.is_current = true
WHERE sp.supplier_id = 'b927dacc-5779-439b-82bf-82ae9c154c00'
ORDER BY sp.supplier_sku;
```

### Results (5 supplier_product records):
