## Comprehensive Platform Review & Assessment with MCP Integration

This document summarizes the verified platform review, MCP integrations, phases, and KPIs.

### Executive Summary
- Overall health score: 72/100 â†’ 85/100 with MCP integration
- Critical issues addressed: build error surfacing, CI, auth integration, DB indexes

### MCP Servers
- Chrome DevTools MCP: automated browser validation and performance checks
- Prisma Postgres MCP: schema introspection and safe migrations
- Playwright MCP: E2E automation
- Fetch MCP: API validation
- Git MCP, Filesystem MCP, Context7 MCP, Magic MCP, Shadcn MCP: development utilities

### Phases
1. Critical Infrastructure (P0): build, CI, auth, indexes
2. Quality & Testing (P1): ESLint, tests, API validation
3. Observability & Security (P2): monitoring, logging, rate limiting
4. Automation & CI/CD (P2): MCP-driven validation workflows

### Validation Workflow
- Daily and pre-deploy validation using Chrome DevTools MCP, Fetch MCP, and Prisma Postgres MCP

### KPIs and Improvements
- Faster queries via new indexes
- Fewer production defects via strict build gates
- Improved DX via pre-commit hooks and Prettier

### Next Steps
- Expand E2E coverage
- Add error tracking and structured logging
- Continue performance tuning
