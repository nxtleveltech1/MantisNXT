# MantisNXT Comprehensive Testing Strategy Implementation Plan

## Project Analysis Summary

**Architecture Identified:**
- Next.js 15 application with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with comprehensive schema
- API routes for inventory, upload, suppliers, etc.
- React components with Radix UI
- MSW for API mocking
- Jest + React Testing Library setup
- Playwright for E2E testing
- XLSX processing for bulk operations

**Current Test Coverage:**
- Basic API tests for inventory endpoints
- Mock server setup with MSW
- Jest configuration with 70% coverage threshold
- Playwright configuration for cross-browser testing
- Component test for XLSX converter
- Integration test for XLSX processing

**Gaps Identified:**
- Missing database integration tests
- No performance testing implementation
- Limited component test coverage
- No data factory/fixture system
- Missing CI/CD test automation
- No test for critical workflows (bulk upload)
- Limited error boundary testing
- No accessibility testing
